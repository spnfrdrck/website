            <h2>How to Cook</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces and season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, cooking until the mushrooms are tender and browned, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Allow it to reduce slightly for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream and dried thyme. Let the mixture simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, stirring to coat the chicken in the creamy sauce. If using, add the grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor and creaminess.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. Serve hot over rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce.</li>

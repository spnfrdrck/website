The rich, dark sauce can be poured over steamed rice, creating a perfect harmony of flavors. Each bite offers a delightful balance of salty, tangy, and umami notes that reflects the essence of Filipino cuisine.
              
              <br><br>Variations of Chicken Adobo exist throughout the Philippines, with some incorporating additional ingredients like potatoes, coconut milk, or hard-boiled eggs.

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>Chicken Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish with origins that reflect the country's rich history and diverse culinary influences. The term "adobo" comes from the Spanish word "adobar," meaning "to marinate." While its roots trace back to pre-colonial times, when indigenous people used vinegar and spices to preserve meat, the arrival of Spanish colonizers in the 16th century introduced new ingredients, particularly soy sauce, which became integral to the dish's marinade.

              <br><br>Over time, Chicken Adobo evolved into various regional adaptations, with different provinces incorporating local ingredients and flavors. Some versions feature coconut milk, potatoes, or hard-boiled eggs, showcasing the dish's versatility. Today, Chicken Adobo is celebrated as the unofficial national dish of the Philippines, symbolizing the blending of indigenous and foreign culinary traditions, and remains a beloved comfort food enjoyed by Filipinos around the world.</p><br><br>

            <h2>How to Cook</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and a pinch of salt. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours (or overnight for better flavor).</li>
                <li>In a large pot or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. If using, add the sliced onions and sauté until they are translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the marinated chicken (reserve the marinade) to the pot and cook for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally until the chicken is lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Pour in the reserved marinade along with the bay leaves and black peppercorns.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little water to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt as needed. The sauce should have a balanced flavor of salty and tangy notes.</li>
                <li>Once done, remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve hot over steamed rice, spooning some sauce over the chicken for added flavor.</li>
            </ol>

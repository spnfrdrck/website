            <p>Fried chicken is a beloved dish known for its irresistible combination of crispy, golden skin and tender, flavorful meat. Each piece is coated in a seasoned batter or flour, then fried to perfection, creating a crunchy exterior that shatters with every bite. Beneath the crisp, crackling surface, the chicken remains juicy and succulent, bursting with savory juices that contrast beautifully with the crust.<br>

               <br> The flavor is deep and satisfying, often infused with a mix of spices like garlic, paprika, black pepper, and a hint of cayenne, giving the chicken a rich, seasoned taste that lingers on the palate. Whether enjoyed hot from the fryer or cooled slightly to savor the complexity of the spices, fried chicken offers a mouthwatering experience that’s both hearty and comforting.<br>
                
               <br> The golden-brown exterior is not just a visual treat but a textural masterpiece, providing a crunchy shell that perfectly complements the soft, moist interior. Whether served with sides like rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes, fried chicken is a timeless dish, cherished for its satisfying crunch, flavorful seasoning, and juicy tenderness..</p> <br><br>

            <h2>How to Cook</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika.</li>
                <li>Remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Let excess marinade drip off, but don’t rinse the chicken.</li>
                <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour mixture, making sure it is fully coated. Shake off any excess flour and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until it reaches about 350°F (175°C). Use enough oil to submerge the chicken pieces.</li>
                <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).</li>
                <li>Once cooked, transfer the fried chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve your homemade Chickenjoy hot with a side of gravy for dipping. Enjoy with rice or your favorite side dishes!</li>
